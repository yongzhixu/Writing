Life on this day.
It is morning, again.
Woke up on the same bed, K put one his usual face.
With shouting came from two of his roommates, K decided to remain lay on for another while. So he let his mind go randomly. 
'Love is not a easy game. Hang on.. From where you draw such a conclusion. Is it the shouting outside of this door or you broke up with you girlfriend days ago? To put an answer over an age-old and wound stained question like love sounds like a joke to K in this moment.'
One could easy drown in its own experiences, wouldn't one? To come to an conclusion whenever mind ran out of patience is an irresitable temptation. 
As this, K wrote down lazily on a tissue. 
Hours clicking. Now, more than past, writing is disturbed by worry about living-necessity, money. K wondering if currency's value kept going down is a conspiracy to gurantee that everyone can not get rid of trouble for a long while, therefore one won't get time to trouble this world. So it is either be a trouble maker or a trouble taker, which one you are? It is evil which keep this world mumbling. Really? K could not help doubting his own prejudices, just like shopping some's game doubting is his. 
Time for heading to the office. K got to say hello to the society which he lives in and try to be a sweetheart so to get some share out of it. 
With thoghts like these jumpin in his mind, K put on clothes and walked out the front door for routines. The lucky side of a job is that he won't have to worry about what to do, repition it is. 
To Mr.lee, K replied 'I am doing great'.


wrote down whatever come to his mind

With shouting comes from the roommates, love, to me, is not a easy game.


between boring and caring, it is 

Wondering what to do. 


What always happens, life.

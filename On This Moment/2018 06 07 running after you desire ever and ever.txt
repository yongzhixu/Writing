keep moving, so release the toture. 
K got the rented house by the stair well, what do you want? he troubled his mind by focusing on this question, well, he was not sure, not ever. Is this why you keeping living, to satisfy your desires? probably... oh no... cut this crap, you live for no fucking reason, you came to this planet for pure chance and no more. frastruated? as always, yes. maybe not in the coming years, while you get dull and bored about this kind of puzzles and move on to another ones, those you will not, as you were, be able to convice yourself settle down upon A conclusion. what then? running after your desires, until that day, that very time.  death, you still miss this world and won't let go?  don't you? 

i just forget what i just wrote down. thoughts come and go with no traces left. 

People talking behind, people gossip. as soon as they group together, they fuck up. 

one give up part of itself for the sake of the group. TRYING hard to please your fellowship.
